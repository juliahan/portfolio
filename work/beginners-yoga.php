					This blog was intended to help people who didn't think they can do yoga ease into the practice of yoga. I worked closely with the Editor of the site. We collaborated on ideas and I designed features such as polls, special sections, illustrations and a Q&A section called "Ask a Yogi" (that was my idea to generate more traffic and to encourage interaction). Furthermore, I created the product's online newsletter template and facebook presence.
