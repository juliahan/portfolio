					The free package shown here is a promotion offered to prospective subscribers through direct mail pieces, magazine inserts and directly through banner ads. The purpose of this page is so customers can sign up for the big gift package quickly and become subscribers permanately. The underwater theme for this page evolved from seeing a beautiful image of the polar bear within the promotional package; I thought the qualities associated with this animal: strength, knowledge and highly regarded in children aligned perfectly with this product.</p>
