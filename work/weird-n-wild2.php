				<h2>WWC Online Banners & Landing Page</h2>
				<p>
					These are banner ads and a landing page I created for IMP's Weird n' Wild Creatures educational product. We launched this website and a keyword campaign quickly after a NYTimes article was published about ways to inspire boys to read since they were failing in schools. "Monsters" and "Creatures" were big themes of the article and therefore became the theme of this landing page.</p>
				<p>Although in the end, after the momentum of the article died down, and after some A/B testing, the even keel dinsaur main image had more purchasing power than the scarier monsters and gremlin themed landing pages.</p>
