					This is the digital invitation for my destination wedding this past year. We wanted our invitation to express who we are &#8212; different and fun. The stars twinkle by using jquery. And using just CSS, the mouth of the male monster opens and closes to reveal the important wedding details. The monster theme was used in all of the the event materials.</p>
