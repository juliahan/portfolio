				<h2>Weird n' Wild Creatures Blog</h2>
				<p>
					This blog is a supplement for collectors of the Weird n' Wild Creatures product, and for children interested in the weird and wild things in the world. I was responsible for spearheading the project, customizing the theme, creating banners for the site/ads to the site, and developing new features.</p>
