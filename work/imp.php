				<h2>imponline.com 2011 site</h2>
				<p>
				This site was a redesign of a previous site for imponline.com. I was restricted in colors and the design of the top navigation bars. The account information was hosted by a 3rd party whose one template was used by the internatinal sites so I was not to changed these elements (if you want to see what it looked like before, just google IMP Poland). Nevertheless, I cleaned up the site, designed icons for key features, and developed a customized wordpress theme with customized widgets. The site was implemented in the United States and a version was being developed for Australia. </p>
