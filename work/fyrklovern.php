					This dinnerware collection needed an online presence. Predominately sold through direct mail in the US, this Swedish chinaware was ready to be sold over the internet. I visualized a modern, clean presence to present the product as high-end and upscale.   I was responsible for the design and development of this e-commerce website and for the design of marketing materials such as landing pages, HTML emails, facebook/social media presence and banner ads.</p>
