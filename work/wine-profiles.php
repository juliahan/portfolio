				<h2>Wine Profiles. Related Emails and Banner Ads</h2>
				<p>A major component of the tastingroom.com product is the personal wine profile. Each Club member receives their own profile based on wines they tasted and rated.  Based on a customer's profile, our sommeliers can figure out what wines the customer will receive in their upcoming wine shipments. I was responsible for the visual representation of the online and print profiles. I created a series of fun, wine loving animal characters to personalize each customers profile. I also used these characters in email campaigns, banner ads and print pieces.
