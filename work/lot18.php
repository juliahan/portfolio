				<h2>tastingroom.com <br />Landing Page</h2>
				<p>Tasting Room is an online wine club that is revolutionizing the way people buy wine. I designed these responsive landing pages as part of the marketing effort to acquire new members and build the business. This particular design was based on extensive survey research asking customers how they like to discover new wines. I also directed the in-house photography.</p>
