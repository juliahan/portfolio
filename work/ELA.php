				<h2>Elmo's Learning Adventure Exclusive Deals</h2>
				<p>
					Riding on the email-coupon wave, this new series by IMP's partner product, Elmo's Learning Adventure, was a way to sell one-time merchandise to their thousands of already existing customers. I was responsible for the design of the website and the design/development of the promotional and transactional emails.
