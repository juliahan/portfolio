					Ellasport is a high-end sportswear company. The products are on par with lululemon and hit the market on the cusp of the yogawear boom. I was first approached to develop an informational site and a Flash Introduction in 2008 by the owner and a graphic designer. Two years later, the owner was ready to sell her products online. I consulted with her on the marketing aspects of the site, and redesigned it to a functional e-commerce site.</p>
